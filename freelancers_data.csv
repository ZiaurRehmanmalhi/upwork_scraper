Zechariah,M.,Exceptional,WordPress,Website,Development,&,Design,United,States,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0179acc0d611244332,$95.00/hr,100%,Job,Success,Top,Rated,Plus,"Creator and owner of ZDM Designs, delivering exceptional websites for exceptional clients since 2006.

A professional and polished website is an invaluable touchpoint for your business. As the primary fuel that drives customer engagement and scalability, it has the power to create lasting first impressions—and because you want those impressions to be great, it cannot be a place of compromise (especially in this economic climate)! 

HIGH QUALITY lead generation depends on your ability to communicate not only the solutions you bring to market, but also the intangibles like trust and reputability that compel casual visitors to become lasting customers and eventually brand ambassadors. These initial decisions are made quicker than most realize. A premium website with attention to fit-and-finish sets the tone and gets you past initial introductions and deeper into dialogue without you doing a thing. A website is your best employee.

I specialize in clean, contemporary, high-converting WordPress websites for entrepreneurs, businesses, and B2B. I've served nearly every industry, including Retail, Healthcare, Non-Profit, Food & Beverage, Business Services, and many more. I leverage your strengths and differentiators within vertical and horizontal markets so you can forge a competitive brand advantage amongst the crowd. I help your website go to work for you!

Need someone to watch over your website or make ad hoc changes? I also offer worry-free reliable maintenance packages, keeping your website updated and current in content and security.

Quality customer service and communication is something I greatly appreciate myself and I go above and beyond so you can enjoy it as well. Make sure to read through my client feedback!

I'm looking forward to making your project a success and helping you take the next important step in your business's growth. Reach out today and get started!

My clients have often consulted me to ""design radical user interface"" in their products. These radical UIs often involve forgetting what is possible with conventional engineering and ""pushing the state of art"" in engineering. I leverage CTO + Product Design skills to show engineers on how they can build some unconventional UIs.

These designs often prompt engineering teams to ""code several UI components from scratch"". I also help Engineers save their time from ""reinventing wheels"". This proves beneficial for Product Design teams - because now they can stay creative (yet practical to meet engineering budgets) and offer a unique user experience.

I work with my team of 2 Product Owners, 3 UX Designers, 2 UI Designer, 2 Fine Artists. Our clients are often startups who are building ambitious engineering-heavy products. The products we built for our clients are currently in use at notable places like  US Airforce, Finland Government, Uber, Snapchat, Melinda & Bill Gates Foundation, Ford, and 1000s of Small Medium businesses

The products we designed for our clients, they raised capital from..
.. Notable investors. Like Google Ventures, the European Commission of R&D Office. 
.. Their own bootstrapped money. Later they went on to raise funds successfully from Venture Capitalists, Crowdfunds, and ICOs.

Sudhir,N.,Prototyper,and,Product,MVP,Designer,Using,Figma,and,Framer,Singapore,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01809d6a0cdbc9a651,$150.00/hr,94%,Job,Success,Top,Rated,Plus,"Prototypes are the secret weapon of successful product managers! They transform abstract ideas into tangible, testable experiences, providing invaluable insights that can steer product development in the right direction and prevent costly missteps. Consider them as your shortcut to user validation and streamlined product development.

𝔸 𝕨𝕖𝕝𝕝-𝕔𝕣𝕒𝕗𝕥𝕖𝕕 𝕡𝕣𝕠𝕥𝕠𝕥𝕪𝕡𝕖 𝕚𝕤 𝕨𝕠𝕣𝕥𝕙 𝕒 𝕥𝕙𝕠𝕦𝕤𝕒𝕟𝕕 𝕞𝕖𝕖𝕥𝕚𝕟𝕘𝕤.

I'm a seasoned Prototyper and UX/UI Designer, proficient in crafting high-fidelity mockups and interactive prototypes. 

In my work, I've transformed initial design concepts into interactive, high-fidelity prototypes. I strongly believe that every prototype is an opportunity to tell a story, letting users 'feel' the product before it's built. This user-first mindset is at the heart of my approach to prototyping.

One of my superpowers is building no-code MVPs. I've found this approach to be incredibly effective at facilitating a fast feedback loop, allowing us to validate ideas quickly and make adjustments based on real user feedback. I've helped several startups go from concept to validated product quickly, saving them time and resources in addition to raising millions $$$.

Working closely with user research, I've facilitated and participated in numerous user testing sessions, iterating on prototypes based on feedback and continuously refining designs. I've seen firsthand how this approach can lead to significant improvements in user satisfaction and a decrease in usability issues.

As a lifelong learner, I am always exploring the latest trends in UX/UI design, prototyping, and design systems. I share this knowledge with my clients, conducting workshops on the latest updates in Figma and Framer and how we can leverage these to enhance our design work.

SKILLS 
 
✅ Customer journey map 
✅ Wireframes 
✅ Hi fidelity mockups 
✅ Prototypes (this is my secret sauce 🔥) 
✅ Web design (UX/UI) 
✅ Mobile design (UX/UI) 
✅ SaaS app design (UX/UI)  

TOOLS  

✅ Figma 
✅ Framer 
✅ Sketch 

MY PRODUCT DESIGN PROCESS

1. **Research** 🔍: Gather and analyze all relevant information. This can include user interviews, market research, competitive analysis, and trend exploration.

2. **Ideation** 💡: Define the problem statement and generate as many solutions as possible based on your research.

3. **Concept Development** 🧠: Develop the best ideas from the ideation phase into more concrete concepts. This could involve creating user personas, user stories, and use case scenarios.

4. **Sketching** ✏️: Make rough sketches of key user interfaces and interactions to represent the earliest visualizations of the product.

5. **Wireframing** 📐: Create more detailed layouts of the product interfaces. Wireframes are like the blueprint of the product and provide a clearer guide of the product structure and functionality.

6. **Prototyping** 👨‍💻: Turn wireframes into interactive mockups. Prototypes help visualize the product and test the usability of the interface before moving to development.

7. **User Testing** 🧪: Test prototypes with users to gather feedback. This can involve a range of qualitative and quantitative methods like usability testing, A/B testing, and interviews.

8. **Iteration** 🔁: Refine and improve the design based on user feedback. This cycle of prototyping, testing, and iteration continues until the design meets the user needs and business goals.

9. **Handoff** 🤝: Once the design is finalized, it's handed off to the development team. Work closely with developers to ensure the design is implemented correctly.

10. **Evaluation** 📊: After the product is launched, continue evaluating its performance and gathering user feedback.

You want to create a new easy to manage web tool that will not only help you reach your customers and provide them with a clear and user-friendly interface, but also convert your web tool users into the army of your loyal customers.

To do that, we together have to achieve the following goals:

 ★ 𝐃𝐄𝐒𝐈𝐆𝐍 ★: Differentiate your brand from the competition with the help of a jaw-dropping, conversion-oriented website design to finally transform curious visitors into high-quality leads, and turn them into your dream customers. 

 📺 𝐅𝐑𝐎𝐍𝐓𝐄𝐍𝐃 📺: Build an engaging and user-friendly user interface that looks cool, works as intended, and loads lightning fast.

 🛠️ 𝐁𝐀𝐂𝐊𝐄𝐍𝐃 🛠️: Build bug-tested software within a predictable time frame to save your time, achieve solid results, and give life to your vision with our 5-star, powerful custom web service.

My name is Pavel, the proud & hard-working founder of tenpixls, an agency that’s growing at a lightning-fast pace.

Our buyers should expect only the best, so here are some crucial points of our agency that I’m sure will convince you that we are the real deal.

We have a 𝐬𝐦𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐡, 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬… plus:

#1️⃣ Awards, reviews, cases, well-known clients, and passed tests confirming that we’re serious about what we do. 🏆

#2️⃣ An innovative vision of bringing mind-blowing results to our clients. 🚀🤯

#3️⃣ The dream team can quickly and efficiently implement that vision. 🧑‍💼👩‍💼

➡️ Our creative team designs and develops eye-catching, virally optimized websites that are custom coded from scratch.

A pretty website doesn't cut it, and it's imperative to use your website as a means to provide users with what they want and what's good for them.

So, how do you do that?

Easy: you set up 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞, which is a fancy word to say ""organized content in a way that makes folks spend.""

The main goal of information architecture in web design is to guide visitors straight to the information that matters the most without any detours or unplanned stops.  

Information architecture should make your content usable through hierarchies, navigation, metadata, and categorizations. 

There are also so many websites that look the same, it’s startling. They all have similar colors, fonts, graphics, and layouts. They’re a copy of a copy of a copy, and that’s not good for business. 😬

Crap work that nobody else can untangle, so you have to redo everything? Lost business opportunities because you haven't launched your MVP on time? Legacy code that not many know how to work with?

However, I cannot help everybody, but we may be a great fit if you are thinking:
🤔 “I value high quality work and am ready to pay for it”
🤔 “I want to ensure my product or script gets professionally built”
🤔 “The last freelancer ghosted me and I lost my opportunity - I don't EVER want that experience again”
🤔 “We're looking to scale to the next level now that we've confirmed people are willing to pay for our product”
🤔 “The mess previous freelancer made forced us to get someone else to rebuild everything”

⭐ Here's what I can bring to your project ⭐
✅ Top-notch knowledge of no-code and low-code tools such as Bubble.io, Webflow, Retool
✅ Always happy to get my hands dirty by adding custom glue code with JavaScript, PHP, and Python

⭐ Why you should choose me over other freelancers ⭐
✅ Trust: I focus on providing value to all of my clients and am always transparent about my processes
✅ WOW Factor: this is core to my work as a freelancer. I strive to give more than what I receive to ultimately make you happy about working with me and choosing to hire me again
✅ Responsiveness: real-time project dashboard with direct lines of communication to get in touch with me ASAP
✅ Problem-solver: I never give up until I find a good solution. I'm not just a developer. I solve problems.
✅ Genuine: I'm rooting for your success. It makes both human and business sense - knowing I've helped you succeed, you'll come back to purchase more of my services!

Whether you’re building a website from scratch, require an upgrade or maintenance of an existing asset, need a web presence that is both responsive and adaptive on mobile phones as well or just need your code audited for best practices – I can work on every aspect of your project based on your specifications.
